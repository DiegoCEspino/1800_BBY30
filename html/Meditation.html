    <p class="Meditation-description">
        Meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that are intended
        to encourage a heightened state of awareness and focused attention.
        Meditation is also a consciousness-changing technique that has been
        shown to have a wide number
        of benefits on psychological well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meditation is simpler (and harder) than most people think.
        Read these steps, make sure you’re somewhere where you can relax
        into this process,
        set a timer, and give it a shot:
    </p>

    <p>
        1) Take a seat
        Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        2) Set a time limit
        If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        3) Notice your body
        You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely
        cross-legged, you can kneel—all are fine.
        Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        4) Feel your breath
        Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.
    </p>
    <p>
        5) Notice when your mind has wandered
        Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places.
        When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds,
        a minute,
        five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath.
    </p>
    <p>
        6) Be kind to your wandering mind
        Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you
        find yourself lost in.
        Just come back.
    </p>
    <p>
        7) Close with kindness
        When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them).
        Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment.
        Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.
    </p>

    That’s it! That’s the practice. You go away, you come back,
    and you try to do it as kindly as possible.
